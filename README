WWW-WebExcel version 0.01
=========================

This module is used to show data in excel-files in the web. It can be used
to provide the results of a database query as an excel-file. It does not provide
cell-formats yet, but the module will be extended within the next weeks.

As a simple example:

	binmode(\*STDOUT);
	my @data;
	$sth->execute() or die $DBI::errstr;
	while(my @row = $sth->fetchrow_array()){
	  push(@data,\@row);
	}
	my $worksheet = ['NAME',{-data => \@data}]
	my $excel = WWW::WebExcel->new(-worksheets => [$worksheet]);
	$excel->output();
