WWW-WebExcel version 0.03
=========================

This module is used to show data in excel-files in the web. It can be used
to provide the results of a database query as an excel-file. It does not provide
cell-formats yet, but the module will be extended within the next weeks.

Compared to version 0.01 there are two new methods in 0.02:
 * add_row      appends new rows to the existing ones
 * set_headers  replaces the existing list of headers

Delta from 0.03 to 0.02:
 * add_row_at   inserts a row into existing data
 * sort_data    sorts the data

As a simple example:

	binmode(\*STDOUT);
	my @data;
	$sth->execute() or die $DBI::errstr;
	while(my @row = $sth->fetchrow_array()){
	  push(@data,\@row);
	}
	my $worksheet = ['NAME',{-data => \@data}]
	my $excel = WWW::WebExcel->new(-worksheets => [$worksheet]);
	$excel->output();
